########################################################################################
## Order of method calls when the world generates:
##    1. create_regions - Creates regions and locations
##    2. create_items - Creates the item pool
##    3. set_rules - Creates rules for accessing regions and locations
##    4. generate_basic - Runs any post item pool options, like place item/category
##    5. pre_fill - Creates the victory location
##
## The create_item method is used by plando and start_inventory settings to create an item from an item name.
## The fill_slot_data method will be used to send data to the Manual client for later use, like deathlink.
